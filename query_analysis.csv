Donald and I have a customer potentially interested in Chennai. 

They have a large presence in Sri Lanka and today are currently hosted in Singapore to manage Sri Lanka.

Does Chennai offer a better option for connectivity/latency versus what they are doing today from Singapore?

Are there any details you can share on what connectivity solutions exist from Chennai to Colombo, Sri Lanka (Enterprise Investment District)

"rewrite I wanted to provide you with a summary specifically for the delay updates that occurred during the NJ event. Dublin sites during a peak volume period.
Early in the incident we identified this to be a Interconnection issue based on the alarms seen by our Global Command Center. The first notice sent was based on what we first received an alarm on. It was determined after that there was a switchgear/electrical outage.
Unfortunately, our GCC was also configured at the Delawanna site and our ability to monitor events, utilize internal support systems including notifications, and phone system all went down. To add, this is one of the two peak times our GCC experiences from a trend perspective. The GCC being down necessitated a failover to our Dublin facility operating at approximately half capacity. Unfortunately, once service was restored at Clifton, a number of IT challenges persisted for several hours, delaying full recovery of the GCC.

Another challenge we had that not only did the DIA and Power go down but it also took down all of the carriers coming into our building due to Carrier configuration not being redundant between Delawanna and the Peekay site. I believe this was explained by Yahel during our last call with you guys as it didn’t just impact our customers but impacted us as well. 
•	Upon failover, Interconnectivity communications were rapidly disseminated to affected customers via our UK GNOC engineers. 
•	Unfortunately, complications with Clifton’s IT environment prevented the phone system switch back to Talk Desk until late evening, prolonging internal DLR operational impacts.

We acknowledge the delays in communication and are working on and had been working on correcting those issues and ensure we have true redundancy for our own internal monitoring, comms, and phone systems. 

We appreciate your patience and continued partnership and truly apologize for the challenges this caused you and your customers with the communication delays and confusion. 

I’ve attached an escalation matrix if there are challenges communicating with the GCC or you aren’t receiving updates in a timely manner during an incident.",4,Site Discovery & Location Queries,2025-10-02T19:30:54.546094,,Yes

"we were down hard in Clifton and failed over at half capacity to Dublin at one of our peak times for volume in tickets and calls. Even when Clifton came back there was a myriad of IT issues that took hours to sort out. It took a long time to identify the Electrical issue and separate from the DIA/Interconnectivity issues. I personally called the property manager to run next door and get me with the engineer (Peter) who filled me in on the UPS/electrical issue and had to get that passed on to the DUB GCC, Roy and Lisa. We got interconnectivity comms out quickly via the GNOC engineers in UK but that only covered a fraction of the customers. You already know about the GSN issues and what we had to work with to get anything out.  I swore the first electrical issue comms came out a little passed 10 AM but I cannot find it.  The other time stamps are above and who received or was sent to.  The Clifton phone systems didnt even get swung back to Talk Desk into the evening because IT and the TD team were having issues all stemmed from the earlier IT issues - please rewrite to make customer facing and condense",4,Site Discovery & Location Queries,2025-10-02T18:19:36.101642,,Yes
